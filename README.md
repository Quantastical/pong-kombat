Pong Kombat
===========

A JavaScript game based on the Stephen Gagne's original Pong / Mortal Kombat hybrid.

Notes
-----

Because the engine uses AJAX to download game assets, in order to test the current build, it will require using a host name for execution. In order words, you can't just open the index.html and expect it to run.

If you want to assist in development, then simply set up a localhost environment that points the downloaded repository directory.
