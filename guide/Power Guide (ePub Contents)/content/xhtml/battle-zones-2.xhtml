				Enormous trees and vegetation grow from the ground up beyond the playing area.
				The plant life rustles in the wind and as animals and rodents scurry across the landscape below.

			<p>
				Hell is a pit of fire and skulls.
				The blazing inferno causes explosions of liquid hot magma and bubbling rivers of lava are below.
			</p>

			<p class="dynamics">

				Sitting in one area too long will slowly deplete their health.
