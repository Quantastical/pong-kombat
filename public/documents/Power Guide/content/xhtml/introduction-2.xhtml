				The popular freeware parody returns!
			</h3>

			<p>
				Originally developed as a school project by Stefan Gagne in 1994, Pong Kombat is reimagined in HTML5, twenty years later.
				Developed by Jeff Jenkins (<a href="http://www.quantastical.com">Quantastical.com</a>), the Pong Kombat rebirth adheres to the original principals and concepts, incorporates popular features of the sequels (Pong Kombat 2 and Pong Kombat 3), while adding in new elements and enhancements.
				Learn new abilities and dismantles, find hidden secrets, and for the first time in the series, compete on-line in the all new <em>Paddle-2-Paddle</em> mode.
