Pong Kombat
===========

So real...it hurts! A mash-up of Pong and Mortal Kombat, first introduced by Stefan Gagne in 1994, finally returns.

Description
-----------

Back in 1994, Stefan Gagne and his cohorts created Pong Kombat--a parody video game and, what would eventually become, a series--featuring lovable characters *ahem* paddles that fought to the death in epic battles of Pong.

The initial game was a school project, adding elements of Mortal Kombat to a Pong match, but it's simple and fun gameplay caused it to "go viral," quickly spawning off sequels, notoriously titled Pong Kombat 2 and Pong Kombat 3.

Now, after two decades, White Paddle returns to the web in...Pong...Kombat...4?
How 'bout, Pong Kombat XX? Or, Pong Kombat HD? PongKombat.com?
Well, whatever it is called, PONG KOMBAT back.
Which paddle will you choose?

Story
-----

White Paddle has reclaimed his place atop the porcelan throne of the Pong Lao Tournament, with the help of some friends.

As they look down upon the citizens of the pong world, *Pongea*, they can only laugh and bellow at their bloated filesize and lossy compression.

With new powers, and an old attitude, it's just a matter of time before White Paddle destroys the universe in a greedy grab for attention.

The next tournament is about to begin.
Do you have what it takes to ascend the ranks and defeat White Paddle?
