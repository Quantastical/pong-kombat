  1                             INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================

The popular freeware title, Pong Kombat, was originally developed as a school
project by Stefan Gagne in 1994. In 2014, Pong Kombat made it's return to the
Internet as web-based freeware title on PongKombat.com.

Developed by Jeff Jenkins (Quantastical.com), the Pong Kombat rebirth adheres
to the original principals and concepts, incorporates popular features of the
sequels (Pong Kombat 2 and Pong Kombat 3), while adding in new elements and
enhancements.


===============================================================================
  2                                STORY
===============================================================================

White Paddle has reclaimed his place atop the porcelan throne of the Pong Lao 
Tournament, with the help of some friends. As they look down upon the citizens 
of the pong world, *Pongea*, they can only laugh and bellow at their bloated 
filesize and lossy compression.

With new powers, and an old attitude, it's just a matter of time before White 
Paddle destroys the universe in a greedy grab for attention.

The next tournament is about to begin. Do you have what it takes to ascend the
ranks and defeat White Paddle?


===============================================================================
  3                               GAMEPLAY
===============================================================================

Pong Kombat combines elments of Atari's PONG and the fighting franchise, Mortal
Kombat. Gameplay resembles a tennis match, with two paddles opposite each other
trying to maintain the volley of a ball. In traditional PONG, failure to return
the volley would result in a point to the opponent.

In Pong Kombat, points are measured as a Life Bar at the top of the field of
play. Ten (10) points constitutes victory and ends the match. During a volley, 
competitors are able to perform Special Abilities that have various effects.

For example, each paddle has a projectile attack that can be sent across the
playing field. If the projectile collides with the opponent, the player will be
awarded with another point, or partial-point, depending on the effectiveness of
the attack.

At the end of the match, the winner is granted the opportunity to "finish off"
their opponent by performing a special finishing move that Dismantles them into
bits and pieces.

  6                             BATTLE ZONES
===============================================================================

Each match in PONG KOMBAT takes place in a unique battle zone. Many of the 
zones have special dynamics that can affect the gameplay, creating a 
challenging experience.

Some of them also feature a special, environment-specific dismantle move.

Hereโs an in-depth look into each zone, giving you an opportunity to learn all 
about them and give you an advantage over your opponent.

Hell is a pit of fire and skulls. The blazing inferno causes explosions of

===============================================================================
  7                           COLLECT-A-BALLS
===============================================================================

At the start of the match, and after failure to return a volley, a ball is put 
into the center of the playing field and launches at a random angle. When balls
are put into play, they are randomly selected from a pool of available options.
Each ball has a distinct size and bouncy-ness to them. New balls are unlocked 
over time, based on the number of matches you have completed.

As you progress, new balls are awarded less frequently, as to follow a pattern 
known as the Fibonacci sequence. Balls will be unlocked after 1 match, again 
after 2 matches, then 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so forth.

Balls can also be unlocked by encountering them while playing against a human 
opponent in a Paddle-2-Paddle match.

a working clock, and even a functional calculator.
