So real...it hurts! A mash-up of Pong and Mortal Kombat, first introduced by 
Stefan Gagne in 1994, finally returns.


===============================================================================
                                DESCRIPTION
===============================================================================

Back in 1994, Stefan Gagne and his cohorts created Pong Kombat--a parody video 
game and, what would eventually become, a series--featuring lovable characters 
*ahem* paddles that fought to the death in epic battles of Pong.

The initial game was a school project, adding elements of Mortal Kombat to a 
Pong match, but it's simple and fun gameplay caused it to "go viral," quickly 
spawning off sequels, notoriously titled Pong Kombat 2 and Pong Kombat 3.

Now, after two decades, White Paddle returns to the web in...Pong...Kombat...4?
How 'bout, Pong Kombat XX? Or, Pong Kombat HD? PongKombat.com? Well, whatever 
it is called, PONG KOMBAT back. Which paddle will you choose?

                                   STORY
===============================================================================

White Paddle has reclaimed his place atop the porcelan throne of the Pong Lao 
Tournament, with the help of some friends. As they look down upon the citizens 
of the pong world, *Pongea*, they can only laugh and bellow at their bloated 
filesize and lossy compression.

With new powers, and an old attitude, it's just a matter of time before White 
Paddle destroys the universe in a greedy grab for attention.

The next tournament is about to begin. Do you have what it takes to ascend the
ranks and defeat White Paddle?
